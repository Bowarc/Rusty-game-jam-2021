# Rusty game jam 2021
## Illusion of security

Hello, this is the repo of the team Eragon, Bowarc for the rusty jam of 2021.


HOW TO USE:  
Put the content of the `/assets` folder in  `/target/debug/resources` or in `/target/release/resources`.  
Use cargo to run it and it should be ok.

### Ideas
A cave/dungeon explorer with shadows and lights.

- [x] Multi-level infinite cave
- [x] Procedurally generated
- [ ] Hostile mobs
- [ ] We should add Ferris. Maybe as an ester egg. (Hidden in the depth there is a species of crab that use rusty ores to make their shells)
- [ ] Crafting ?
- [ ] Weapons
- [ ] Inventory
