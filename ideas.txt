Game idea{
    Cave explorer with shadows and lights.

    Procedurally generated ?

    We should add Ferris. Maybe as an ester egg

    crafting(weapons an other type of things), (Inventory and stuff upgrades)

    You will find less and less crafted stuff as you go down. But you can find better ore

    Maybe add an other type of dificulty
    enemies, less vision(that you could upgrade with torchs)
